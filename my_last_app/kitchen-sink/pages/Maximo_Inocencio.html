	<p>MÃ¡ximo Inocencio's mother was a direct descendant of the Spanish family Franco.
	<p>His father was a seaman who made voyages to and from Mexico. He was still a boy when his father died.
	<p>Although one source identifies Inocencio as an architect and a carpenter by profession, little is known about his schooling.
	<p>He pursued an independent occupation as an apprentice in a carpentry shop of the arsenal in Cavite.
	<p>He later became a contractor and erected churches, bridges, buildings, and other public works in Cavite.
	<p>His shop was located at San Roque, employing about 25 men.
