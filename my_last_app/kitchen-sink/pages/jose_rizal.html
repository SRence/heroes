	<p>The Philippines' national hero. Born in Calamba, Laguna, on June 19, 1861.
	<p>Published his masterpiece Noli Me Tangere in Berlin(Germany) in 1887 and his second novel El Filibusterismo in Ghent(Belgium) in 1891.
	<p>His two novels stirred the conscience of his people. He contributed various literary works to La Solidaridad.
	<p>For his leadership in the reform movement and for his incendiary novels,
	<p>Rizal was arrested and later killed by musketry in Bagumbayan, Manila, on December 30, 1896.
	<p>His execution was the last straw for other Filipinos who called for a bloody revolution against Spain.
